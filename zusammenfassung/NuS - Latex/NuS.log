Package scrartcl Warning: You've used obsolete option `6pt'.
(scrartcl)                Usage of this option indicates an old document
(scrartcl)                and changes compatibility level using
(scrartcl)                `fontsize=6pt,version=first,
(scrartcl)                enabledeprecatedfontcommands' that may result
(scrartcl)                in further warnings.
(scrartcl)                If you don't want this, you should simply
(scrartcl)                replace option `6pt' by `fontsize=6pt'.

Class scrartcl Info: Switching compatibility level to `first'.

Class scrartcl Warning: deprecated option `enabledeprecatedfontcommands'.
(scrartcl)              Note, that this option was already depreacted when
(scrartcl)              it has been defined. Support for old font commands
(scrartcl)              has been removed from KOMA-Script more than one
(scrartcl)              decade ago. It is not recommended to use them any
(scrartcl)              longer. Therefore usage of this class option also
(scrartcl)              is not recommended.

(typearea)             If you'd like to set the option with \KOMAoptions,
(typearea)             you'd have to use `paper=a4' there
(typearea)             instead of `a4paper', too.

Class scrartcl Warning: deprecated old font command `\sf' used.
(scrartcl)              You should note, that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a
(scrartcl)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrartcl)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrartcl)              defined the old font commands like `\sf' only for
(scrartcl)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrartcl)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrartcl)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrartcl)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrartcl)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrartcl)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
(scrartcl)              not work any longer. If loading a package results in
(scrartcl)              this message you should contact the author of that
(scrartcl)              package and ask him to replace the depracted font
(scrartcl)              command `\sf', e.g., by `\normalfont \sffamily '.
(scrartcl)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the
(scrartcl)              package. If you have used the old font command
(scrartcl)              `\sf' yourself you should replace it, e.g., by
(scrartcl)              `\normalfont \sffamily ' on input line 120.


Class scrartcl Warning: deprecated old font command `\bf' used.

Class scrartcl Warning: deprecated old font command `\sf' used.
(scrartcl)              You should note, that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a
(scrartcl)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrartcl)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrartcl)              defined the old font commands like `\sf' only for
(scrartcl)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrartcl)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrartcl)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrartcl)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrartcl)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrartcl)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
(scrartcl)              not work any longer. If loading a package results in
(scrartcl)              this message you should contact the author of that
(scrartcl)              package and ask him to replace the depracted font
(scrartcl)              command `\sf', e.g., by `\normalfont \sffamily '.
(scrartcl)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the
(scrartcl)              package. If you have used the old font command
(scrartcl)              `\sf' yourself you should replace it, e.g., by
(scrartcl)              `\normalfont \sffamily ' on input line 194.

Class scrartcl Warning: deprecated old font command `\sf' used.
(scrartcl)              You should note, that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a
(scrartcl)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrartcl)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrartcl)              defined the old font commands like `\sf' only for
(scrartcl)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrartcl)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrartcl)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrartcl)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrartcl)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrartcl)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
(scrartcl)              not work any longer. If loading a package results in
(scrartcl)              this message you should contact the author of that
(scrartcl)              package and ask him to replace the depracted font

(scrartcl)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the
(scrartcl)              package. If you have used the old font command

A left brace was mandatory here, so I've put one in.
You might want to delete and/or insert some corrections
so that I will find a matching right brace soon.

Class scrartcl Warning: deprecated old font command `\sf' used.
(scrartcl)              You should note, that since 1994 LaTeX2e provides a
(scrartcl)              new font selection scheme called NFSS2 with several
(scrartcl)              new, combinable font commands. New KOMA-Script classes
(scrartcl)              defined the old font commands like `\sf' only for
(scrartcl)              compatibility with LaTeX 2.09 document styles of
(scrartcl)              Script 2.0. These commands are deprecated and
(scrartcl)              undocumented at least since 2003. Since 2013,
(scrartcl)              KOMA-Script classes warned about soon removement of
(scrartcl)              these deprecated commands. Now, after two decades of
(scrartcl)              LaTeX2e, NFSS2, and KOMA-Script these commands will
(scrartcl)              not work any longer. If loading a package results in
(scrartcl)              this message you should contact the author of that
(scrartcl)              package and ask him to replace the depracted font
(scrartcl)              command `\sf', e.g., by `\normalfont \sffamily '.
(scrartcl)              Otherwise you should reconfigure or replace the
(scrartcl)              package. If you have used the old font command
(scrartcl)              `\sf' yourself you should replace it, e.g., by
(scrartcl)              `\normalfont \sffamily ' on input line 524.
